Hi! My name is Vladimir Malinovkii, you can contact me using telegram [@galqiwi](https://t.me/galqiwi). There is some stuff i've been working on:
- [telegram bot](https://github.com/galqiwi/techo) for sending notifications written in go,
- very simple [library](https://github.com/galqiwi/simple_nn) for training neural networks,
- [ray marcher](https://github.com/galqiwi/numpy-marcher) that is implemented using pure numpy,
- [neural network](https://github.com/galqiwi/vae-lstm-midi-generator) that can generate music using LSTM and VAE as a second semester project at DGAP,
- [bunch of small scripts](https://github.com/galqiwi/vk-clones) i used to mess with vk api for my [article on habr.com](https://habr.com/ru/post/449656/).
